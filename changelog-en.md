- Own contribution calculator:
	- [#1317](https://github.com/dsiekiera/foe-helfer-extension/issues/1317) Sound when switching a repeatable "output X FP" quest does not play reliably
	- [#1318](https://github.com/dsiekiera/foe-helfer-extension/issues/1318) Sound in the cost calculator comes in Bronze Age until FMA also at the quest "explore 2 technologies

**New**
